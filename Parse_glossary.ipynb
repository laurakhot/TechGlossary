Decryption is an operation which transforms a ciphertext message into plaintext using a cryptographic algorithm called a cipher. Like encryption, decryption in modern ciphers is performed by using a specific algorithm and a secret, called the key. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption and if the key stays secret, is mathematically hard to perform. How hard it is depends on how secure the cryptographic algorithm is, and that in itself is subject to change as the study of cryptanalysis advances.  \n",

Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference — type coercion is implicit whereas type conversion can be either implicit or explicit. Examples ```js const value1 = \"5\"; const value2 = 9; let sum = value1 + value2; console.log(sum); ``` In the above example, JavaScript has coerced the 9 from a number into a string and then concatenated the two values together, resulting in a string of 59. JavaScript had a choice between a string or a number and decided to use a string. The compiler could have coerced the 5 into a number and returned a sum of 14, but it did not. To return this result, you'd have to explicitly convert the 5 to a number using the Global_Objects/Number method: js sum = Number(value1) + value2;  \n",

Cryptography designs and studies algorithms used to encode and decode messages in an insecure environment, and their applications. More than just data confidentiality, cryptography also tackles identification, authentication, non-repudiation, and data integrity. Therefore it also studies usage of cryptographic methods in context, cryptosystems.  \n",

      "600  In CSS, flow relative values are directional keyword values relative to an element's block and inline axes. These values include block-start, block-end, inline-start, inline-end, start, and end. In CSS, physical properties define positions based on physical directions and reference specific sides of an element. CSS logical properties on the other hand define styles based on the document's writing mode and direction rather than the physical dimensions of the viewport. Logical properties are relative to the content flow and use directional keywords relative to the block and inline axes. Block direction The block axis refers to the axis that defines the stacking order of elements in a block layout. It's essentially the direction along which blocks of content — like paragraphs (p), headings, and divs (div) — are laid out on a webpage. This is also known as the block direction. In left-to-right and right-to-left languages, the block direction is the vertical direction of the content flow, going from top to bottom. The block-start and block-end directions represent the start edge and end edge of content along the block axis, or the \"from\" and \"to\" directions, respectively, with block-start being the equivalent of top and block-end being the equivalent of bottom in horizontal writing modes. Inline direction The inline axis is perpendicular to the block axis. The inline axis represents the direction along which inline content like text flows within a block. This is also known as the inline direction. In left-to-right writing modes, like English, the inline direction is horizontal, left-to-right. In right-to-left languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, the inline direction is horizontal, right-to-left. Inline-start and inline-end represent the start edge and end edge of content along the inline axis, respectively, with the values and properties inline-start and inline-end being the equivalent of left and right properties and values in horizontal writing modes. Whether they are equivalent to right or left depends on the writing direction. For example, inline-start is equivalent to left in left-to-right languages and right in right-to-left languages. Start and end A CSS property's effects can be either one-dimensional or two-dimensional. For example, text-align concerns the inline direction of text only, so is one-dimensional. When contextually constrained to one dimension, the flow-relative keywords are abbreviated to just start or end.  \n",
