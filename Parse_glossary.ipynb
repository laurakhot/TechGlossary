Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLs based on browsing history and related searches. For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request. Although browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, they consume additional bandwidth.

It was used to make text content blink on and off (flash) continually. The &lt;blink&gt; element was used like this: html example-bad &lt;blink&gt;In ancient browsers, I may have blinked&lt;/blink&gt; Brief history In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The CSS specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The &lt;blink&gt; element was one of these, introduced in early versions of Netscape Navigator; Internet Explorer's marquee element was another. The &lt;blink&gt; element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer Lou Montulli and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it (read the story here). While initially popular, &lt;blink&gt; became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or cognitive disorders such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even trigger seizures. &lt;blink&gt; was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history. Alternatives The CSS text-decoration-line property has a blink value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it. The JavaScript String.blink() method wraps a text string in &lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt; tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere. CSS animations could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view. A scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars. Scrollport The scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.

ARPANET first ran NCP (Network Control Protocol) and subsequently the first version of the Internet protocol or TCP/IPv4 suite, making ARPANET a prominent part of the nascent Internet. ARPANET was closed in early 1990. See also ARPANET on Wikipedia Related glossary terms: arpa TCP  \n",

Grid areas are created when you place an item using line-based placement or when defining areas using named grid areas. Grid areas must be rectangular in nature; it is not possible to create, for example, a T- or L-shaped grid area. Example In the example below I have a grid container with two grid items. I have named these with the grid-area property and then laid them out on the grid using grid-template-areas. This creates two grid areas, one covering four grid cells, the other two. ```css hidden * { box-sizing: border-box; } .wrapper { border: 2px solid #f76707; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #fff4e6; } .wrapper > div { border: 2px solid #ffa94d; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #ffd8a8; padding: 1em; color: #d9480f; } ``` css .wrapper { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); grid-template-rows: 100px 100px; grid-template-areas: \"a a b\" \"a a b\"; } .item1 { grid-area: a; } .item2 { grid-area: b; } ```html Item Item ``` Example See also Property reference grid-template-columns grid-template-rows grid-auto-rows grid-auto-columns grid-template-areas grid-area Further reading CSS grid layout Guide: Basic concepts of grid layout Grid template areas Definition of grid areas in the CSS grid layout specification  \n",

In HTML, a elements define hyperlinks from a spot on a webpage (like a text string or image) to another spot on some other webpage (or even on the same page).

The promise literally represents a promise made by the function that it will eventually return a result through the promise object. When the called function finishes its work asynchronous, a function on the promise object called a resolution (or fulfillment, or completion) handler is called to let the original caller know that the task is complete.

Smoke testing comes before further, in-depth testing. Smoke testing answers questions like \"Does the program start up correctly?\" \"Do the main control buttons function?\" \"Can you save a simple blank new test user account?\" If this basic functionality fails, there is no point investing time in more detailed QA work at this stage.

Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not seek. Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLs based on browsing history and related searches. For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request. Although browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, they consume additional bandwidth. Also, pre-loaded websites and embedded content can set and read their cookies as if they were visited even if they weren't. See also Related glossary terms: prerender prefetch  \n",
       "599  The <blink> element (blink tag) is an obsolete HTML feature no longer supported by web browsers and no longer documented on MDN. It was used to make text content blink on and off (flash) continually. The <blink> element was used like this: html example-bad <blink>In ancient browsers, I may have blinked</blink> Brief history In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The CSS specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The <blink> element was one of these, introduced in early versions of Netscape Navigator; Internet Explorer's marquee element was another. The <blink> element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer Lou Montulli and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it (read the story here). While initially popular, <blink> became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or cognitive disorders such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even trigger seizures. <blink> was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history. Alternatives The CSS text-decoration-line property has a blink value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it. The JavaScript String.blink() method wraps a text string in <blink></blink> tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere. CSS animations could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

A user agent adds scroll bars to an element box to make it a scroll container when the CSS overflow property is set to scroll or when overflow is set to auto and the content overflows the container. When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view. A scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars. Scrollport The scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.

For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request. Although browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, they consume additional bandwidth.

It was used to make text content blink on and off (flash) continually. The &lt;blink&gt; element was used like this: html example-bad &lt;blink&gt;In ancient browsers, I may have blinked&lt;/blink&gt; Brief history In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The CSS specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The &lt;blink&gt; element was one of these, introduced in early versions of Netscape Navigator; Internet Explorer's marquee element was another. The &lt;blink&gt; element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer Lou Montulli and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it (read the story here). While initially popular, &lt;blink&gt; became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or cognitive disorders such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even trigger seizures. &lt;blink&gt; was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history. Alternatives The CSS text-decoration-line property has a blink value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it. The JavaScript String.blink() method wraps a text string in &lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt; tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere. CSS animations could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

       "      <td>A scroll container is an element box in which content can be scrolled, whether or not scroll bars are present. A user agent adds scroll bars to an element box to make it a scroll container when the CSS overflow property is set to scroll or when overflow is set to auto and the content overflows the container. When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view. A scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars. Scrollport The scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.

Smoke testing comes before further, in-depth testing. Smoke testing answers questions like \"Does the program start up correctly?\" \"Do the main control buttons function?\" \"Can you save a simple blank new test user account?\" If this basic functionality fails, there is no point investing time in more detailed QA work at this stage.

Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not seek. Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLs based on browsing history and related searches. For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request. Although browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, they consume additional bandwidth. Also, pre-loaded websites and embedded content can set and read their cookies as if they were visited even if they weren't. See also Related glossary terms: prerender prefetch  \n",
       "2756  The <blink> element (blink tag) is an obsolete HTML feature no longer supported by web browsers and no longer documented on MDN. It was used to make text content blink on and off (flash) continually. The <blink> element was used like this: html example-bad <blink>In ancient browsers, I may have blinked</blink> Brief history In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The CSS specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The <blink> element was one of these, introduced in early versions of Netscape Navigator; Internet Explorer's marquee element was another. The <blink> element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer Lou Montulli and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it (read the story here). While initially popular, <blink> became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or cognitive disorders such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even trigger seizures. <blink> was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history. Alternatives The CSS text-decoration-line property has a blink value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it. The JavaScript String.blink() method wraps a text string in <blink></blink> tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere. CSS animations could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

A user agent adds scroll bars to an element box to make it a scroll container when the CSS overflow property is set to scroll or when overflow is set to auto and the content overflows the container. When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view. A scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars. Scrollport The scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.

For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request.

The &lt;blink&gt; element was used like this: html example-bad &lt;blink&gt;In ancient browsers, I may have blinked&lt;/blink&gt; Brief history In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The CSS specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The &lt;blink&gt; element was one of these, introduced in early versions of Netscape Navigator; Internet Explorer's marquee element was another. The &lt;blink&gt; element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer Lou Montulli and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it (read the story here). While initially popular, &lt;blink&gt; became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or cognitive disorders such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even trigger seizures. &lt;blink&gt; was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history. Alternatives The CSS text-decoration-line property has a blink value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it. The JavaScript String.blink() method wraps a text string in &lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt; tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere. CSS animations could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

A user agent adds scroll bars to an element box to make it a scroll container when the CSS overflow property is set to scroll or when overflow is set to auto and the content overflows the container. When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view. A scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars. Scrollport The scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.

Smoke testing comes before further, in-depth testing. Smoke testing answers questions like \"Does the program start up correctly?\" \"Do the main control buttons function?\" \"Can you save a simple blank new test user account?\" If this basic functionality fails, there is no point investing time in more detailed QA work at this stage.

Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not seek. Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLs based on browsing history and related searches. For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request. Although browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, they consume additional bandwidth. Also, pre-loaded websites and embedded content can set and read their cookies as if they were visited even if they weren't. See also Related glossary terms: prerender prefetch   \n",
       "2756  The <blink> element (blink tag) is an obsolete HTML feature no longer supported by web browsers and no longer documented on MDN. It was used to make text content blink on and off (flash) continually. The <blink> element was used like this: html example-bad <blink>In ancient browsers, I may have blinked</blink> Brief history In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The CSS specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The <blink> element was one of these, introduced in early versions of Netscape Navigator; Internet Explorer's marquee element was another. The <blink> element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer Lou Montulli and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it (read the story here). While initially popular, <blink> became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or cognitive disorders such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even trigger seizures. <blink> was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history. Alternatives The CSS text-decoration-line property has a blink value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it. The JavaScript String.blink() method wraps a text string in <blink></blink> tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere. CSS animations could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

A user agent adds scroll bars to an element box to make it a scroll container when the CSS overflow property is set to scroll or when overflow is set to auto and the content overflows the container. When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view. A scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars. Scrollport The scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.

For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request.

       "      <td>The &lt;blink&gt; element (blink tag) is an obsolete HTML feature no longer supported by web browsers and no longer documented on MDN. It was used to make text content blink on and off (flash) continually. The &lt;blink&gt; element was used like this: html example-bad &lt;blink&gt;In ancient browsers, I may have blinked&lt;/blink&gt; Brief history In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The CSS specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The &lt;blink&gt; element was one of these, introduced in early versions of Netscape Navigator; Internet Explorer's marquee element was another. The &lt;blink&gt; element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer Lou Montulli and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it (read the story here). While initially popular, &lt;blink&gt; became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or cognitive disorders such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even trigger seizures. &lt;blink&gt; was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history. Alternatives The CSS text-decoration-line property has a blink value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it. The JavaScript String.blink() method wraps a text string in &lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt; tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere. CSS animations could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

Smoke testing comes before further, in-depth testing. Smoke testing answers questions like \"Does the program start up correctly?\" \"Do the main control buttons function?\" \"Can you save a simple blank new test user account?\" If this basic functionality fails, there is no point investing time in more detailed QA work at this stage.

Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not seek. Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLs based on browsing history and related searches. For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request. Although browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, they consume additional bandwidth. Also, pre-loaded websites and embedded content can set and read their cookies as if they were visited even if they weren't. See also Related glossary terms: prerender prefetch   \n",
       "2756  The <blink> element (blink tag) is an obsolete HTML feature no longer supported by web browsers and no longer documented on MDN. It was used to make text content blink on and off (flash) continually. The <blink> element was used like this: html example-bad <blink>In ancient browsers, I may have blinked</blink> Brief history In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The CSS specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The <blink> element was one of these, introduced in early versions of Netscape Navigator; Internet Explorer's marquee element was another. The <blink> element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer Lou Montulli and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it (read the story here). While initially popular, <blink> became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or cognitive disorders such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even trigger seizures. <blink> was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history. Alternatives The CSS text-decoration-line property has a blink value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it. The JavaScript String.blink() method wraps a text string in <blink></blink> tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere. CSS animations could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

A user agent adds scroll bars to an element box to make it a scroll container when the CSS overflow property is set to scroll or when overflow is set to auto and the content overflows the container. When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view. A scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars. Scrollport The scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.
